# HDBResalePrice
Prediction of HDB resale prices on Kaggle for CS5228

# Task Description
The resale market of HDB flats is big business in Singapore. To find a good prices as either a buyer or a seller, it is important to have good understanding of what affects the market value of a HDB flat. Most people would accept that attributes such as the size and type of flat, its floor, but also its location to nearby amenities (e.g., MRT stations, parks, malls, commercial centers) influence the resale price of the flat. However, it is not obvious which attributes are indeed most important in a quantified sense.<br>
The goal of this project is to predict the resale price of a HDB flat based on its properties (e.g., size, #rooms, type, model, location). It is therefore first and foremost a regression task. Besides to prediction outcome in terms of a dollar value, other useful results include the importance of different attributes, the evaluation and comparison of different regression techniques, an error analysis and discussion about limitations and potential extensions, etc.
